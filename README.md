# Tears of the Kingdom Armor Tracker

This application is a work-in-progress designed to aid in the management of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom armor acquisition and levels of improvement by Great Fairies.

## Key Utility
Presently, the application is able to define each individual armor item, provide a location (either exact geocoordinates or approximate location, e.g. shop or cave), define how many items and rupees are required to level the individual armor pieces to maximum (level 4), and aggregate all items to define how many items are required to level up *all* pieces to maximum.

## Functionality in Waiting
- Save states (so that you can exit the app without needing to restart your progress)
- Better geocordinates (so that you can find the exact location of each item without needing to know where each specific cave is, for example)
- Item icons (so you know what each item looks like)
- Set bonus declarations (so you know what the items do, what their set bonus is, and whether you've acquired the set bonus yet)
